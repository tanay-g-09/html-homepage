        <h1>Passed away on January 26, 2020</h1>
        <p>
          died on January 26, 2020, due to blunt force trauma sustained in a
          helicopter crash in Calabasas, California. The crash occurred during
          dense fog, which severely reduced visibility. Investigations concluded
          that the pilot likely became spatially disoriented, causing the
          helicopter to descend rapidly and collide with a hillside. There was
          no evidence of mechanical failure, and all nine people on board,
          including Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna Bryant, were killed
          instantly.
